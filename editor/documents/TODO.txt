Todo check list:

FOr Model Viewer;
- None.

Common (Level Editor and ModelViewer)
- Bump/Normal Mapping for OBJ and MD5.
- MD5 normals

Level Editor:
1. can we request on Undo feature?
2. Frustum culling support -- immediate --> Done.
3. opengl texture sampling
4. md5 support in editor
5. point light
6. specular/shinyness
7. shadow mapping
8. add square mountain just like golden sun --> not so priority.
9. adjustable/editable texture tiled rate including paint tiled rate -- immediate
10.adjustable ambient/diffuse light - immediate
11. resize object features. --> high priority. --> Done


Maybe
1. Apply Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
2. Specular lighting/shinyness

Overall Priority in Order:
- resize object
- Frustum culling --> Done, no terrain triangle check yet.
- editable tiled rate   --> VOID feature, imposible to modify without affecting main texture rate
- shader include --> Done and working.
- adjust diffuse/ambient lighting --> Done. Ambient and Diffuse settings not yet saved to file. Support SSAO in the future.
- apply normals and lights for OBJ and MD5. --> Added normals for OBJ, no MD5 normals yet
- apply bump mapping.
- multiple lights/deferred shading.
- Shadow implementation.

REMINDER:

1. Mark label: ZBU_UNSURE -- for engine, platform and OS specific concerns. Just search in code
                           it might work in windows but not in Android/Linux based

2. mark label: ZBU_TODO -- for todo list, example: Texture Manager, Loader
			search string "TODO"

3. Directory should not have a "slash" at the end

4. Review String handling in the code, it might slow down code in mobile.

5. Version of shader should not be included in shader file, it is automatically attached by GfxShader class.

------------------
MUST DESIGN EFFICIENTLY!!

1. Handling of Bounding Box to Scene Node relation must be optimized and design efficiently,
including the checking of bounding box to frustum, and transforming min/max to world matrix.

2. Math and intersection classed must be separated. Bounding Box against Ray, 
check on SceneObject::MousePick.
